                <p> Pizza, is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round,
                    flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other
                    ingredients
                    (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high
                    temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
